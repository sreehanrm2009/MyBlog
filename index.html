                A city of contrasts, Hyderabad exudes an old-world charm of its own with the Old City (Charminar side), Hitech City (Cyberabad) and the other areas lying between the old and the new. The capital and the largest city of Telangana, Hyderabad is home to stately mosques and noisy bazaars lined parallelly alongside swanky new office buildings and malls, and it is these very contrasts – these glimpses into the city’s rich past with inherent promises of an even better future –that make Hyderabad a city worth visiting. Maybe even more than once.
                <br>
                The city of pearls and biryani, Hyderabad is home to one of the most iconic landmarks - the Charminar. Translating to 'four minarets', the grand edifice is built entirely out of limestone and granite, with four minarets on four sides, each of them facing a different street. The Charminar stands in a labyrinth of lanes crammed with shops, markets, stalls and shoppers - one of the best places to shop for the authentic pearls and relish the tasty biryanis, skewer kebabs and haleem (the smorgasbord of food that Hyderabad is known for).
                <br>
                The other side of Hyderabad - HiTech City or Cyberabad - is a stark contrast to the Old City. The area teems with grand malls, pulsating clubs, sleek restaurants and hi-rise buildings of the every-growing multinationals. Between the old and new lie the popular city areas of Banjara Hills and Jubilee Hills flanked on the northeast by Secunderabad. Hyderabad and Secunderabad together are still referred to as the "twin cities", though they are practically one now.
                <br>
                Hyderabad pulsates with a spectacular mix of people and traditions. Make a journey through this mind-stirring metropolis and be ready to be amazed, frustrated, confounded and thrilled, all at once!

                Papikondalu mountain range runs along the River Godavari (Western Godavari) and is located in Rajahmundry, Andhra Pradesh. Papikondalu is a sheer fest to the eyes in terms of its scenic beauty. As the hills become closer and closer to the visitor, the width of the mighty Godavari becomes narrower. In accordance with this view resembling the middle partition of a woman's hair, it was initially named as 'Papidi' Kondalu- Paidi in Telugu means the middle partition of a woman’s hair. Later, it came to be known as Papikondalu in the local language. The river narrowing, its twists and turns along with the Papi Hills form a breathtaking visual experience.
                <br>
                Its beauty is often compared to that of Kashmir as the area around the ranges is quaint and bountiful with nature. The ranges also boast of waterfalls at Munivaatnam.

                Nagarjunasagar is a site of spectacular man-made marvel flanked by equally enchanting panoramic vistas of lush green surrounding. Lying in the Nalgonda District of Andhra Pradesh, the most popular landmark of the town is world's tallest masonry dam Nagarjunasagar dam built over Krishna River.
                <br>
                With the capacity of irrigating around 10 acres of land, this modern architectural grandeur is a sight to behold. Other than that, the town is also renowned for much the talked about the excavation of Buddhist Civilization. An island named as Nagarjuna Konda lying amidst the man-made lake is a site where the relics of such great significance are preserved. In fact, the town got its present name from a Buddhist saint and scholar Acharya Nagarjuna. The town of Nagarjunasagar or Vijayapuri as it was earlier known is today blessed by the Mother Nature in full glory. Visit this absolutely bewitching site to connect yourself with nature and various aspects of Buddhism.

                The Warangal city is credited as the fifth largest city in this state. The legends have it that it was known as Oruguallu or Omtikonda or Ekasilanagaram mainly due to the existence of a huge hillock which seemed to have been carved out entirely off one stone.

Warangal natural beauty is no less impressive and the Parkhal Lake and wildlife sanctuaries are also definitely worth checking out.

            Overwhelming. It best describes the final chapter that culminates Marvel Cinematic Universe’s 21 iconic films into one. And that also describes the experience of watching your favourite superheroes come together for a singular goal, for one last time. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo ensure that the humongous build-up and the avalanche of expectations do not get the better of them. They deliver a largely wholesome product that is full of moments laced with action, emotion, comedy and drama. Writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely take you along, even if you haven’t been following the franchise. They do an incredible job with the screenplay to balance emotions with visual spectacle. So if you’re not a fan yet, chances are, you might become one after watching this instalment.
            <br>
            While the screen time for each character is not equal, their significance in the story is. And there are enough surprises in store, as far as their fates are concerned. ‘Endgame’ delivers quite well on the emotional quotient, bringing out superpowers and vulnerabilities of its cinematic demigods through their measured performances. From an upright Captain America (Chris Evans) to a stoic Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and from a straight-faced Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) delivering the punches to the reassuring presence of Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), ‘Endgame’ has it all and a lot more. Thanks to the conviction in performances, you also might just find yourself rooting for the bad guy, Thanos (Josh Brolin) at some point. However, it’s the comic collective of Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and Ant Man (Paul Rudd) that ensures there are enough lighter moments in this otherwise heartfelt finale.
            <br>
            The action becomes progressively intense, but never overbearing. In fact, it remains relevant and true to the narrative, such that it weaves in enough opportunities for major plot twists that even the diehard fans may not see coming. The extensive CGI work adds to the visual appeal, even in 2D.
            <br>
            For the non-fans, the film’s explanatory tone might come across as a speed breaker at times, but for the fans, the same invokes hope and excitement, leading to constant gasps and howls.
            <br>
            Overall, 'Avengers: Endgame' is a befitting tribute to the Cinematic Universe that has spawned larger-than-life superheroes and super fans. At three hours plus, ‘Endgame’ delivers on a lot of its hallmark promises, leaving its fans with a range of emotions and fond memories.

            To say this live-action film is a computer-animated remake of 1994’s animated classic doesn’t quite justify its visual impact. The technical advancement in computer animation is on full display here, and it’s genuinely staggering to experience. There are moments when you will wonder if you're watching a wildlife documentary, albeit with one big difference. It’s all scripted with a story you’re familiar with, especially if you’ve watched the 1994 version. So, you already know how this all plays out, and there are virtually no surprises at all. The performances feel somewhat restricted by the realistic portrayal of animals in this version, as it leaves very little room to emote besides the voice work. 
            <br>
            This is where things get really tricky, despite having an immensely talented voice cast. Both Donald Glover and Beyoncé Knowles have the singing credentials, and while Glover adds some charisma to Simba, Nala doesn’t get much to speak of. Still, their relationship is charming in parts. Chiwetel Ejiofor certainly does more to make Scar menacing, and perhaps just enough to remember him as a formidable villain. The most enjoyable characters are Pumbaa and Timon, voiced by Seth Rogen and Billy Eichner respectively. They lighten up the proceedings and bring some much-needed personality with the adorable warthog and meerkat combination. A spin-off featuring Simba, Pumbaa and Timon would be well-received and arguably far more entertaining. As he did in the original, James Earl Jones plays Mufasa once again to bring home the nostalgic factor.
            <br>
            But there's only so much mileage you can get on nostalgia. ‘The Lion King’ is a shot-by-shot, track-by-track remake which highlights the challenge with the onslaught of live-action re-creations. Is it preferable to stick to the source material, or does it make sense to change it up for current audiences? Jon Favreau prefers to play it safe here, and although that may leave an impression on new audiences, those who have grown up on the animated classic might struggle to find their childhood sentiments revived.
            <br>
            Nevertheless, watching this family-favourite come to life will trigger enough awe-inspiring moments thanks to its visual achievements, and that itself warrants a trip to your nearest 3D screen.
